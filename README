Launching the program
==================

Launch our code you need to run the launch.py script.

The script should be run using the following command:

`python launch.py [options] pitch side colour serial-port role`

options:
-q  - skip the 10 second delay when starting the program

pitch  [0,1] 
0 if we are on the main pitch and 1 in the side room. 

side [left, right]
says what side of the pitch we are on. 
This can sometimes be somewhat counter intuitive so make sure you have put in the right side. 

colour [blue, yellow]
colour is completely useless and will be removed in a later version, however it is required to run at this moment in time.

serial-port /path/to/port
Is the path to the radio stick port. 
The port can be found in /dev (use ls /dev to find it)
It is usually either /dev/ttyACM0 or dev/ttyACM1

role [attacker,defender]
Decides which set of plans we should execute. 
Defender is the pass ball plan while attacker is the align and shoot at goal plans. 

==================
Running the simulator
==================

Run the simulator using
    python Simulate.py
    
The starting positions of the robots can be changed in Simulate.py
If using 32 bit python (not on DICE), the SHOWLABELS flag can be changed to True. This allows drawing planning state.

Other simulator variables can be changed in Simulator/Simulator.py
